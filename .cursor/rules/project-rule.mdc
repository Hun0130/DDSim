Always ask before editing core Fast DDS code.

When a detailed analysis of a specific file is requested, provide line-by-line comments in Korean.

When creating a new source file, ask for confirmation first.

If approved, include line-by-line comments in Korean.

Operating system-level and network-level behaviors may be simplified or abstracted.

No need to implement full low-level interactions.

There is no library name 'fastrtps', It's 'fastdds'
